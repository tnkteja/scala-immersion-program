## Outcomes
The following is my self-assessment with out of 10 for  each Concept or Technology or Language.

**On a scale of 10, I would rate myself as `5`**

**What I already know..**

I have created concurrent programs in the past but not extensively.

**What I learned..**

* Actor based programming paradigm
* Concept of reactive-streams, and programming using Akka.

### Kafka (5)
**On a scale of 10, I would rate myself as `5`**

**What I already know..**

I learned about kafka on my own about some of its basic concepts.

**What I learned..**
