## Outcomes
The following is my self-assessment with out of 10 for  each Concept or Technology or Language.

* I know python, cpp, Javascript, golang,and Java

**What I learned..**

* Scala is fully loaded with functional and object oriented programming features.
* While the syntax is somplaces similar to python and golang, the language is more programmer friendly for its declarative nature.
